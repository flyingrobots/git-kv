# Task: Create CI Workflow File

**Feature:** `Foundational CI/CD Pipeline`

## 1. Description

Create the initial GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that defines the basic structure for the Continuous Integration pipeline.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- A `ci.yml` file exists at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- The workflow is named descriptively (e.g., "CI Pipeline").
- It is configured to trigger on `push` events to the `main` branch.
- It is configured to trigger on `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.
- It defines a single job (e.g., `build-and-test`) that runs on a Linux runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).

## 3. Test Plan

- **Manual Test:** Push an empty commit to a test branch and open a PR to `main`. Verify that the workflow is triggered and appears in the GitHub Actions tab.
- **Manual Test:** Push a commit directly to `main` (if allowed). Verify the workflow is triggered.
