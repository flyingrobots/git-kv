# Task: Create CI Workflow File

**Feature:** `Foundational CI/CD Pipeline`

## 1. Description

Create the initial GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that defines the basic structure for the Continuous Integration pipeline.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- A `ci.yml` file exists at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- The workflow is named descriptively (e.g., "CI Pipeline").
- Triggers on `push` events to the `main` branch.
- Triggers on `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.
- Defines a single job (for example, `build-and-test`) that runs on a Linux runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`) and includes, at minimum, the following functional steps so the job performs real work:
  - Check out the repository using `actions/checkout@v5` (see `docs/ci-action-versions.md` for canonical action versions).
  - Set up the required runtime with the appropriate setup action, using the latest stable version recommended for your runtime (or pinning to a tested major release for reproducibility).
  - Install project dependencies by running the project's install command (for example, `npm ci`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, or `./gradlew dependencies`).
  - Run the project's automated test command (for example, `npm test`, `pytest`, or `./gradlew test`).
  - Optionally build artifacts and upload test results or build outputs using actions such as `actions/upload-artifact@v4`.

## 3. Test Plan

- **Integration Test (PR Trigger):**
  1. Push a commit to a test branch.
  2. Open a Pull Request from the test branch to `main`.
  3. Confirm the workflow is triggered in the GitHub Actions tab for the PR.
  4. Confirm the `build-and-test` job appears, runs all configured steps, and completes with a green checkmark (success status).
  5. Inspect the job logs to verify it ran on `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Integration Test (Direct Push Trigger):**
  1. If branch protection permits, push a commit directly to `main`. Otherwise, mirror `main` to a test branch and push a commit there.
  2. Repeat steps 2-5 from the PR Trigger test plan to verify execution and green-check completion.
