# Task: Stargate Passive Node Rejection

**Feature:** `US-G10 â€” HA Failover`

## 1. Description

Modify the Stargate's `pre-receive` hook to reject write operations if the current instance is not the elected leader. This prevents split-brain scenarios and ensures all writes go through the authoritative node.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- The `pre-receive` hook (or the validation logic it calls) checks the current leadership status of the Stargate instance.
- If the instance is a passive (non-leader) node, the hook immediately rejects the push.
- The rejection message is clear and indicates that the node is not the leader.
- The hook exits with a specific non-zero status code (e.g., `9` as per the spec).

## 3. Test Plan

- **Integration Test:** Deploy two Stargate instances (one leader, one passive). Attempt to push a `git kv set` operation directly to the passive node's Git endpoint. Verify the push is rejected with the correct error message and exit code.
- **Integration Test:** Verify that pushes to the active leader node are accepted normally.
