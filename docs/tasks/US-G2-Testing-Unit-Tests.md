# Task: Unit Tests for `mset` Client Logic

**Feature:** `US-G2 â€” Atomic transaction via Stargate`

## 1. Description

Create a suite of unit tests for the client-side logic developed for the `mset` feature. This includes testing the tree construction and commit generation in isolation.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- Unit tests are created for the **Client-Side Tree Construction** logic.
  - Tests cover `set`, `del`, and mixed operations.
  - Tests cover error conditions like malformed input.
- Unit tests are created for the **Client-Side Commit Generation** logic.
  - Tests verify the correctness of the generated commit messages and trailers.
  - Tests verify the parent-child relationship of the commits.
- All tests are self-contained and do not require a live Git repository to run (they should use in-memory or mock objects).
- The tests are integrated into the `make test` command.

## 3. Test Plan

- **Execution:** Run `make test` and verify that the new unit tests are executed and pass.
- **Code Coverage:** Measure the code coverage of the new tests and ensure they cover the critical paths of the tree construction and commit generation logic.
