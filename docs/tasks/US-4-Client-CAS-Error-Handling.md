# Task: Client-Side CAS Error Handling

**Feature:** `US-4 â€” CAS on branch`

## 1. Description

Implement the client-side logic to handle the specific rejection that occurs during a failed Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operation. The user should receive a clear, understandable error instead of a generic `git push` failure.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- **Dependency:** This task depends on `US-4-Stargate-CAS-Check.md` for the exact CAS conflict error format.
- When a `git push` from a `set` or `mset` command with `--expect-tree` is rejected by the Stargate, the client inspects the stderr output from Git.
- The client must detect the exact CAS conflict error message: "ERROR: CAS_CONFLICT: Expected tree OID mismatch."
- The client CLI **must** exit with exit code `2`.
- The client CLI **must** print the exact user-facing message: "Error: A concurrent modification occurred. Please try again."

## 3. Test Plan

- **Integration Test:** Use the CAS failure integration test from the Stargate task. Run the client command that is expected to fail and assert that it exits with the correct exit code (e.g., `2`) and that the error message printed to the user is the friendly, expected message.
- **Unit Test:** Write a unit test that feeds mock `git` stderr output (both for CAS failure and other generic failures) to the error handling function and verify it behaves correctly.
