# Task: Document Docker Development Workflow

**Feature:** `Dockerized Development Environment`

## 1. Description

Add clear instructions to the `README.md` file explaining how to set up and use the Dockerized development environment.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- The `README.md` contains a new section titled "Dockerized Development Environment" or similar.
- This section provides step-by-step instructions on:
  - How to build the Docker image.
  - How to start the development container.
  - How to access the container's shell.
  - How to run tests and linters from both the host and inside the container.
  - How to stop and clean up the container.
- The documentation emphasizes the benefits of using the Dockerized environment.

## 3. Test Plan

- **Manual Review:** Read the updated `README.md` and verify the instructions are clear, accurate, and easy to follow for a new developer.
- **Manual Test:** Follow the instructions in the `README.md` from a clean environment and verify that the Dockerized setup works as described.
