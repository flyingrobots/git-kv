# Task: Stargate Health Endpoints

**Feature:** `US-G10 â€” HA Failover`

## 1. Description

Implement standard HTTP health endpoints (`/healthz` and `/readyz`) for the Stargate service. These endpoints are crucial for load balancers, orchestrators (like Kubernetes), and monitoring systems to determine the health and readiness of Stargate instances.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- The Stargate service exposes an HTTP server (e.g., on a configurable port).
- A `/healthz` endpoint is available.
  - It returns HTTP 200 OK if the Stargate process is running and basic dependencies (e.g., Git repository access) are functional.
  - It returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error otherwise.
- A `/readyz` endpoint is available.
  - It returns HTTP 200 OK only if the Stargate instance is the elected leader AND its mirror remote (GitHub) is reachable AND its internal work queues (e.g., mirror queue, watchlog queue) meet operational thresholds.
  - **Queue Thresholds:**
    - Per-queue depth must be below 100 items (`pending_count <= 100`).
    - Or, the queue processing success rate must be above 95% over the last 5 minutes (`processed_count / (processed_count + pending_count) >= 0.95`).
  - It returns HTTP 503 Service Unavailable otherwise, with a body detailing which queue is unhealthy.

## 3. Test Plan

- **Unit Test:** Test the logic for each health check condition in isolation.
- **Integration Test (`/healthz`):** Start the Stargate service. Verify `/healthz` returns 200. Simulate a repository access failure and verify it returns 500.
- **Integration Test (`/readyz`):** Start two Stargate instances. Verify the leader's `/readyz` returns 200. Verify the passive node's `/readyz` returns 503. Simulate a GitHub connectivity issue on the leader and verify its `/readyz` returns 503.
